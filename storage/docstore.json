bridge the gap between network operators and application developers. This post initially\u2026 Read More APIs enabling seamless access to Telco network capabilities Telco network capabilities exposed through APIs provide a large benefit for customers. By simplifying telco network complexity with APIs and making the APIs available across telco networks and countries, CAMARA enables easy and seamless access. Download Solutions Sheet Telco network capabilities are functions partly available already in 4G but new and much more powerful in the 5G network. These functions enable to get information out of the network but also to configure the network. The on-demand, secure and controlled exposure of these capabilities pave the way for transforming operator networks into service enablement platforms, facilitating the application-to-network integration, which will be key to deliver enhanced and servicetailored customer experience in the 5G era. Abstraction by transformation from network capabilities to Service APIs is necessary: To simplify telco complexity making APIs easy to consume for customers with no telco expertise (user-friendly APIs) To satisfy data privacy and regulatory requirements To facilitate application to network integration CAMARA is an open source project within Linux Foundation to define, develop and test the APIs. CAMARA works in close collaboration with the GSMA Operator Platform Group to align API requirements and publish API definitions. Harmonization of APIs is achieved through fast and agile created working code with developer-friendly documentation. API definitions and reference implementations are free to use (Apache2.0 license).

There are two meta-releases per year (in spring and fall). API providers (e.g. Network operators, Channel Partners) can plan their implementations and deployments in production. API consumers can plan the integration in their platform and applications. All API versions in a meta-release fulfill defined quality criteria and are compliant to the CAMARA guidelines from CAMARA Commonalities and Identity and Consent Management of that meta-release. CAMARA meta-releases ensure the Availability of consistent API definitions (by use of guidelines, templates, and linting), Quality of API definitions (by use of checklists, test definitions, and release management), Stability of API definitions (clear criteria for stable versus initial API versions) and Reliability of schedule and deliverables (with defined milestones and release candidates). CAMARA meta-releases provide the foundation for API version management in production. For details see https://wiki.camaraproject.org/display/CAM/Meta-release+Process . 2 meta-releases per Year Fall (in September) Spring (in March) Continuous and Overlapping Cycles Update of CAMARA guidelines Development and updates of API definitions in CAMARA Lab implementations and production deployments at network operators Tests of API Release Candidates In (operator) lab implementations Based on CAMARA test definitions Feedback in All Phases From (lab) implementations and deployments to CAMARA API definitions and guidelines From API definition work to CAMARA guidelines Get in touch and join today!

Instead of making direct API calls, developers can subscribe to roaming status events, which notify them when the device enters or exits a roaming state and provide the current location, including the country. This method ensures that developers receive timely updates without the need to continuously query the status. Use Cases Fraud Prevention: A bank subscribes to the roaming status updates to detect unusual device activity. If a device attempts to access an account from a different country and is not roaming, a fraud alert is triggered automatically without the need for continuous checks. Content Restrictions: A streaming service subscribes to roaming updates to ensure users are only able to view content within authorized regions. When the device roams into a different country, the system is automatically notified, and the user is restricted from accessing location-based content. Advertising: An advertiser subscribes to roaming status events to ensure ads are displayed only in specific countries or regions. When a device enters a new country, the system is notified, and the ad campaign is adjusted accordingly to match the user\u2019s location. Benefits Real-Time Push Notifications: Developers can subscribe to the roaming status and receive instant notifications whenever the status changes, eliminating the need for repeated polling. Regulatory Compliance: Ensures that devices are operating within the legal boundaries of region-specific rules and regulations by automatically updating their status. Fraud Prevention: Provides real-time alerts if a device unexpectedly enters an unauthorized region, helping to prevent fraud or unauthorized access without constant querying.

The service producers, deployed at the Telco Edge Cloud, are referred as Edge Application Servers (EAS). The life cycle management of the EAS can be done with the CAMARA \u201cEdge Application Management\u201d API whose definition is in the CAMARA Edge Cloud repository . The Telco Edge Cloud is composed by Edge Cloud regions that contain Edge Cloud zones. For a more complete definition of such Telco Edge Cloud architecture, please refer to the \u201cEdge Application Management\u201d API documentation. A developer can deploy and run applications on an Edge Cloud zone, meaning reduced latency to end users that are nearby, as the network path is shorter. A network operator\u2019s Edge Cloud may comprise multiple Edge Cloud zones, each in a discrete location to bring latency benefits to end users across a country. The operator can help developers knowing which of the Edge Cloud zones will bring the optimal performance for a given end user and application. The TI API provides the optimal routing from the user device (e.g. a smartphone) to the optimal EAS instance in a specific geographical location, installed in an Edge Cloud zone. If a service is offered by cloud instances and by Edge Cloud instances, the TI API can be used to get the optimal routing of the traffic to the Edge Cloud instances, maybe for a set of users. Getting the optimal routing can be used to improve latency maybe in combination with other CAMARA APIs such as \u201cQuality On Demand\u201d. Providing the optimal routing is indeed an important step to get the optimal latency. If the TI API is used to get the best routing at the Edge Cloud for a device in a geographical location and the device moves to another geographical location, the TI API can be invoked to get the optimal routing in the new geographical location for that device. While the goal of the TI API is to optimize the traffic in the mobile network to reach the local instance of the EAS, it is a task of the application to generate the flow toward the expected EAS instance. Use Cases A service is usually provided by a cloud instance of an application for free use. In a specific geographical area, the service is provided by an Edge Cloud instance of that application for premium use. The service producer invokes the TI API to optimize the traffic flow toward the Edge Cloud instance of the application for the premium use. Customers with premium use access the service in that geographical area with the best user experience while customers with free use get a best effort service provided by the cloud instances of the service. When a customer with premium use moves among different geographical areas where the service is optimized at the Edge Cloud, the TI API can be invoked to activate the network optimization to always provide the optimal experience. Specific use case examples are. Optimal Routing: Ensures the best routing from user devices to EAS instances for improved performance. Latency Reduction: Helps reduce latency by routing traffic to the nearest Edge Cloud zones. Dynamic Adaptation: Adjusts routing dynamically as devices move to different geographical locations. Benefits A service provider can differentiate the service quality offering access to premium Edge Cloud resources to selected customers and assuring the best network optimization when the customer is moving in different geographical areas. By that the end user gets the optimal latency. Operational efficiency for the API customer (cost savings) is also benefit.

Subscription Benefit : With the Device Quality Indicator API, these platforms can subscribe to real-time network status updates for their users. If a device\u2019s connectivity status changes from 5G to 3G, the platform can automatically adjust the stream quality to avoid buffering and improve the user experience. When network conditions improve, the quality can be enhanced again without user intervention. Example : A user starts watching a video in 4K (on 5G) and as they move into a low-coverage area, the network drops to 2G. The API immediately sends an alert, triggering the platform to switch the video to SD or audio-only to ensure playback continuity. Gaming Platforms : Scenario : Online multiplayer games need to maintain a stable connection for real-time gameplay. Fluctuations in network quality (e.g., moving from 4G to 3G) can impact gameplay, causing lag or disconnections. Subscription Benefit : Game developers can subscribe to the Device Quality Indicator API to receive notifications when a player\u2019s network status changes. When a player\u2019s device moves from a high-speed connection (e.g., 4G) to a lower speed (e.g., 3G), the system can automatically adjust game settings to reduce the data load (e.g., lowering the game\u2019s graphical quality or switching to less frequent server updates) to maintain a smoother gaming experience. Example : A player\u2019s device switches from 5G to 3G, and the gaming platform gets an instant update via the subscription, prompting it to reduce the resolution and data requests to minimize latency. Mobile Video Conferencing : Scenario : Video conferencing apps (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams) need to ensure a stable connection for quality video and audio calls, and user experience can degrade with network changes. Subscription Benefit : With the subscription model, the application will receive notifications whenever a participant\u2019s network connection changes (e.g., from 4G LTE to 2G). This will allow the app to adjust the call quality or switch to audio-only mode to avoid disruptions during the conference call. Example : A participant in a video conference moves from 4G to 2G. The system, upon receiving the real-time notification, automatically switches the call to audio-only to maintain connection stability. Mobile Content Delivery & Media Apps : Scenario : Content providers (e.g., video or image-heavy apps) need to deliver the appropriate media content based on the device\u2019s available data and network conditions. Subscription Benefit : Content providers can subscribe to network status changes for their users, so they can send lower-quality content when the network is slow or prioritize high-definition content when a fast connection is available. This reduces data wastage and improves the user experience. Example : A content delivery app subscribes to network changes. When the user moves from 4G LTE to 3G, the system automatically switches to sending lower-quality images or video to ensure the content is delivered without buffering or data issues. Smart  Devices : Scenario : IoT (Internet of Things) devices in a smart  environment, like security cameras or smart thermostats, often depend on the device\u2019s mobile network for data transmission. Subscription Benefit : The Device Quality Indicator API allows the system to adjust frequency or data volume of transmissions to avoid overload. Example : A smart metering device only sends data if the device is reachable by 3G, 4G or 5G.

In response, governments and organizations are working to improve mechanisms for age-based access control, with initiatives such as the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) and national regulations like those proposed in Spain for mandatory age verification. Telecommunications operators can play a vital role in this by offering an API to streamline age verification across countries. Since operators already manage verified user data, such as date of birth linked to mobile numbers, they can provide a seamless and privacy-compliant solution for digital platforms. This \u201cKnow Your Customer Age Verification\u201d API can be applied in various scenarios, including streaming services, gaming platforms, online marketplaces, and adult content websites, ensuring compliance with regulations while reducing friction in the user experience. Use Cases Age Validation during Registration to adapt services offered : Many service providers, especially those legally required to verify age (e.g., banks, betting sites), already use strict verification methods like passport scanning. However, many e-commerce platforms don\u2019t enforce such controls, allowing minors to easily register and access services like online supermarkets, including purchasing age-restricted items like alcohol. A reliable third-party age verification API can help fill this gap. Access to Age-Restricted Sites with Light Verification : Some sites, such as social networks or e-commerce platforms, don\u2019t require strict age verification and only ask for basic registration details like an email and password. While user friction is minimized for easier access, this lax verification has led to reputational and legal challenges, as minors can access harmful content like violence or pornography. More robust age verification measures are becoming increasingly necessary. Age Restrictions for Advertisers : Advertisers target internet users based on site audience profiles, with many sites displaying ads without verifying the age of visitors. For example, sports betting ads may appear on general sports sites, assuming all users are of legal age. The Know Your Customer Age Verification API can help developers restrict specific ads from being shown to minors, improving ad targeting and compliance with age restrictions. Telco Services : Telecommunications companies (Telcos) can use the age verification API to protect minors in services like TV content, enhancing the safety of residential services by ensuring that age-restricted content is inaccessible to children. This tool could help businesses in the B2C sector better safeguard their offerings. Benefits For end users: Children will have additional protection when using internet, preventing them from accessing inappropriate content for their age group. For parents: Parents will gain peace of mind when leaving children to use mobile phones and tablets. For digital content/service providers: Using the Know Your Customer Age Verification API offers an effective, lightweight alternative to the common method of user self-declaration (e.g., claiming they are over 18). Unlike more intrusive verifications like digital document scans or facial recognition, the API adds minimal friction to the user login/access process. This is possible because mobile network operators (MNOs) handle the hard verifications upfront when they gather users\u2019 birthdate data linked to their mobile lines, which is later used by the age verification API. For Society: Our society needs a safer internet especially to protect the most vulnerable people.

Upon the request of a given shopper, the API allows merchants (commonly through a channel partner or payment aggregator) to initiate refund requests to CSPs. The API supports reimbursement of the full amount of a captured payment or a partial refund. When the API is used within Direct Carrier Billing services offered by carriers, refunds are typically executed asynchronously, being reflected in the next bill or prepaid balance. However, it is at the discretion of each carrier to decide how refunds are made effective. It\u2019s important to emphasize that refunds can only be initiated for payments that have already been captured. Payments that have not yet been captured should be canceled instead. Use Cases The Carrier Billing Refund API is used by merchants that implement Direct Carrier Billing as a payment method. All use cases require the existence of a previous purchase using a Carrier Billing service, so there must be an identifier for the previous purchase transaction, to which the refund is linked: Request for a total or partial refund of a purchase due to the return of the product or service. The conditions for accepting and processing the refund are subject to the specific conditions of each merchant. Request for a refund due to erroneous or improper charges. Benefits Transparency for the end user. The API allows the merchant to manage the refund with the operator directly or through a payment aggregator. The buyer keeps the merchant as a point of  for the refund claim. Uniform interface for merchants and aggregators. The implementation of the CAMARA API by operators allows reducing friction in the integration of merchants and aggregators, since they can use the same integration. The API allows for a high degree of flexibility and granularity in terms of the structure of amounts returned per item, taxes, etc. API Portfolio: Payments and Charging SubProject Wiki: N/a, Independent Sandbox, See API Wiki (incl. how to meet the team) API Wiki: Carrier Billing Check Out API Repository: Carrier Billing Check Out API Repository Status: Sandbox API Status: Initial API Version(s) and Release Date(s): v0.1.0 (05.09.2024), first public release v0.1.1 (23.11.2024), Fall24 meta-release v0.2.0 (11.03.2025), Spring25 meta-release API availability: Information which APIs are available in which country and network, and how to get access can be found on the GSMA public launch status page .

Instead of repeatedly querying the API, developers can receive notifications when there is a change in the connectivity status of the device. The notifications include details  whether the device is connected to 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, or has UNKNOWN connectivity. This system provides more efficient and immediate updates without the need for continuous polling. Use Cases Emergency Services : Emergency applications can subscribe to receive notifications  the connectivity status of critical response team members. When a device\u2019s connectivity changes (e.g., from 4G to 2G or 5G to 3G), the system sends a notification. This allows the system to dynamically adjust the communication method (SMS, data) based on real-time changes in network type, ensuring that alerts are delivered despite potential connectivity issues. Customer Support Platforms : A customer support platform can subscribe to device connectivity updates. If the connectivity status changes (e.g., from 4G to 3G), the platform can automatically switch to SMS communication if data connectivity becomes unavailable. This helps avoid failed communication attempts and improves customer experience by ensuring messages are delivered using the most reliable medium. IoT Devices : A fleet management system can subscribe to real-time updates regarding the connectivity status of IoT devices in vehicles. If a device\u2019s connectivity status changes (e.g., from 5G to 4G or 2G), the system can adjust its monitoring strategy, reducing data usage or switching to SMS-based communication for low-connectivity situations. Benefits Real-time Notifications on Connectivity Changes : The Connected Network Type Subscription API provides real-time notifications whenever a device\u2019s network connectivity changes. Efficient Resource Management : With a subscription-based model, the system notifies developers only when a change occurs, eliminating the need for frequent API requests. Improved User Experience and Communication Reliability : The API sends real-time connectivity status changes, allowing businesses to respond faster and more effectively to changes in the device\u2019s network connection.

It provides businesses with insights into whether a SIM card has been swapped recently, either by returning a timestamp of the last change or a yes/no response for a defined period (e.g., the last 24 hours). Additionally, the API offers a subscription mode, enabling businesses to receive real-time notifications whenever there is a change in the SIM card status. This service is particularly valuable for enhancing security in scenarios like fraud prevention, account protection, and transaction validation by identifying potential unauthorized SIM swaps. Use Cases Fraud prevention in banking: A bank may query the API when a transaction appears suspicious. The SIM swap information feeds into the bank risk decision engine and security measures are applied accordingly by the bank. Also, strange behaviors or accumulation of SIM Swap notifications may help banks detect fraud scenarios in advance. Fraud prevention for password reset (various sectors: e-commerce, social networks, etc.): Password reset is often protected via a mobile verification e.g. One Time Password SMS. The online service provider may query the Sim Swap API to secure the mobile verification. A recent SIM swap may indicate a risk of account takeover fraud and the service provider can adapt the security measures accordingly. Benefits Prevention of Fraudulent Activities : The Sim Swap API helps businesses detect and prevent unauthorized SIM swap attempts, a common method used in account takeover fraud. By identifying changes in a user\u2019s SIM card status, the API provides an additional layer of security for sensitive transactions and account access. Enhanced Security for User Accounts: This service ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts or authorize transactions by verifying that the mobile line has not been compromised. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and protects both users and businesses from potential breaches. Seamless Integration for Risk Management: The Sim Swap API can be easily integrated into existing systems to provide real-time insights into SIM changes. This allows businesses to incorporate it into their risk assessment processes, enabling proactive responses to suspicious activity without disrupting user experience. Improved Trust and User Confidence : By safeguarding user accounts against SIM swap fraud, businesses can build trust with their customers. Users benefit from knowing their accounts are protected, which enhances satisfaction and loyalty while reducing the likelihood of service abandonment due to security concerns.

This feature is ideal for tracking the movement of assets or users, enhancing security through real-time monitoring of high-value goods or individuals, or enabling location-based marketing campaigns. Use Cases Logistics, Industry, Goods delivery and Fleet management: For example, a logistics company can use the Geofencing Subscriptions API to monitor high-value shipments in transit. By setting up geofences around key locations such as warehouses or transport routes, the company receives real-time alerts whenever a shipment enters or exits a designated area. This helps ensure the security and timely delivery of assets, while minimizing the risk of theft or misplacement. Personal security: For example, a company providing employee safety services can use the Geofencing Subscriptions API to track the location of field workers in real-time. If an employee enters a restricted or hazardous area, the system can send an alert to supervisors or security teams, ensuring quick responses in case of emergencies and improving overall workplace safety. Personalization and Marketing: For example, a retail business leverages the Geofencing Subscriptions API to send personalized offers to customers as they enter a specific shopping area. By triggering notifications based on the customer\u2019s real-time location, the business can deliver location-based promotions, increasing engagement and driving sales while ensuring the accuracy of targeting through reliable, tamper-proof location data. Location-Based Marketing: Enabling targeted marketing campaigns by sending notifications to users when they enter specific geographic areas. Event Management: Monitoring the movement of attendees at events to ensure they remain within the event premises. Benefits Enhanced User Experience: Users benefit from more secure and personalized services, receiving timely alerts, relevant offers, and location-based notifications that improve convenience and engagement. Improved Security and Safety: The real-time location tracking helps ensure the safety of individuals or assets by triggering alerts in case of deviations from expected locations, reducing the risk of theft, misplacement, or hazards. Increased Operational Efficiency: Service providers gain the ability to monitor and manage assets, employees, or resources in real time, leading to better decision-making, quicker responses to critical situations, and streamlined operations. Accurate, Tamper-Proof Location Data: The use of reliable, MNO-verified location data ensures the accuracy of location-based services, marketing, and security measures, fostering trust and confidence in the services provided.

CAMARA only works on customer-facing northbound APIs. East-west federation / roaming APIs are out of scope for CAMARA. Northbound scope We differentiate between 3 types of Northbound APIs: Service APIs: APIs intended for end consumers and integrated by developers to invoke a certain telco capability. Service Management APIs: APIs intended for end consumers to manage or get data  offered Service APIs in application runtime, e.g., check service availability or performance information. Operate APIs: Operational and maintenance APIs provided by a telco to channel partners for the purpose of service fulfillment and assurance to their [channel partner] customers. This may include service provisioning for a mobile user, technical API performance monitoring, fault ticketing, information exchange such as product catalog, pricing, settlement, etc. In the following picture you can find an illustration of these 3 types of APIs. Service APIs and Service Management APIs are in scope of CAMARA (and both will be referred to in the following as CAMARA APIs), Operate APIs are out of scope of CAMARA (these are already covered by other SDOs = Standards Development Organizations like TM Forum). Figure 1 \u2013 Interface types in NaaS Transformation functions Service APIs and Service Management APIs mean an abstraction / aggregation of e.g. 3GPP APIs, Broadband Forum APIs or ETSI MEC APIs to hide telco complexity, keep control at the operator side and fulfill regulatory and data privacy constraints. Figure 2 \u2013 The transformation function translates exposed service APIs into call flows that invoke internal telco capabilities The definition and documentation of CAMARA APIs (including the mapping tables for the attributes to the southbound APIs if useful) is in scope of the Project and in scope of the harmonization. The transformations functions (business logic that calls the southbound APIs, transforms the data and provides the function for the CAMARA APIs) are in scope of the Project as example or reference implementations, but not in scope of the harmonization. So each telco operator can implement the transformation functions in the best manner considering network topology and vendors, and can use the reference implementation as an orientation and starting point. API consumption The way how the different API types shall be consumed is shown in the figure below. Figure 3 \u2013 Typical consumers / producers of each API types Hyperscalers and aggregators have the possibility to create own enriched products based on the CAMARA APIs and expose that in addition to the CAMARA APIs. Remark: In Figure 1, 3 and 4 we mention \u201cConsumers\u201d, \u201cEnd Consumers\u201d and \u201cAPI Consumers\u201d in the following sense: Developers of customer companies or independent developers can include API calls into their applications/code End users of these applications then trigger API calls while using the applications Alignment with other SDOs The following picture shows how the different API standards complement each other. Figure 4 \u2013 Different entities participating in the NaaS service standardization CAMARA project defines CAMARA APIs, with a contribution-driven approach and in collaboration with the developer community. TMForum develops the Operate APIs, as an evolution of its Open APIs, working jointly with aggregator and developer platform owners, to facilitate their integration with the operator\u2019s NaaS Platforms. Several SDOs cover the different technology domains that provide the telco capabilities, through Technology-specific APIs, that are exposed by CAMARA, like Broadband Forum ( and fixed access networks), O-RAN (Radio access network), IETF and ONF (Transport networks), 3GPP (Radio access and core networks), ETSI (network function virtualization), Cloud Native Computing Foundation (container management), etc. These SDOs provide exposure functions to be able to interact with the network systems from external platforms.

With this API, when someone calls the API service with network SLA requirements, telecom operators can create non-public cloud leased network services, by orchestrating the IP VPN connections of metropolitan network and/or backbone network. Use Cases This API is applicable for providing multi-site, multi-cloud network connection for customers, and provide virtual private network services for industries and applications such as education, medical, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud desktop, cloud conference, cloud recording and etc. For example, the first use case is a digital exhibition application that needs to render a digital model in the central cloud and use the rendering model in the edge cloud. The digital exhibition application deployed in local site subscribes the Site To Cloud VPN API service between local site and edge cloud, thus the customers to the digital exhibition hall in the local site can access rendering application with large bandwidth and will enjoy good experience. The second use case is for cloud court application which requires secure and large bandwidth to deliver trial video materials to the central cloud since these video materials need to be stored for a long time, so cloud court application is suitable to call the Site To Cloud VPN API to achieve elastic, private and secure data delivery and storage. Benefits Easy use/invocation : The Site To Cloud VPN API enables users to create and configure site \u2013 to \u2013 cloud network services with just one click, which significantly reduces the operation complexity and saves time. Fast service provisioning : When users demand non \u2013 public cloud leased network services with certain SLA requirements, telecom operators can quickly set up the service by coordinating the IP VPN connections of relevant networks, ensuring rapid service deployment. Flexibly expanded con n ection of customers\u2019 branch sites : This API offers great flexibility in expanding customers\u2019 branch \u2013 site connections.

This post initially published on the CableLabs Blog; republished here with permission By Ben Hepworth , Principal Architect, CableLabs Key Points A new release from the Linux Foundation\u2019s CAMARA project includes 38 APIs, further helping bridge the gap between network operators and application developers. CableLabs contributions fall within our ongoing work to develop Network as a Service, a standardized solution for connecting applications to network services. Last year, we shared how CableLabs is transforming networks through open-source API solutions as part of our work in the CAMARA project . Today, we\u2019re excited to highlight the progress made in CAMARA\u2019s newly published spring 2025 meta-release . The new release includes significant updates across CAMARA\u2019s expanding suite of open network APIs \u2014 and spotlights CableLabs\u2019 continued contributions to this global effort. We actively contribute to the open-source project, which is hosted by Linux Foundation , to drive the development of new APIs and help advance industry alignment. These contributions are all part of CableLabs\u2019 work on Network as a Service (NaaS), which allows network operators to expose previously unavailable features to application developers via open-source APIs. Other contributors to CAMARA include network operators \u2014 both wired and mobile \u2014 as well as application developers and hardware vendors. Through this open-source approach, CAMARA aims to ultimately improve the performance of applications across all types of networks \u2014 a win for the entire industry. What\u2019s New in CAMARA\u2019s Spring 2025 Meta-Release? CAMARA\u2019s spring 2025 meta-release marks a major milestone for the project, boasting 38 APIs \u2014 9 stable APIs, plus 13 new and 16 updated APIs. The project continues to grow in momentum and industry adoption, bridging the gap between network operators and application developers through a common set of open APIs. Here are some of the highlights from the Spring25 release that multiple service operators (MSOs) should have on their radar: Quality on Demand (QoD) with advanced quality of service (QoS) profile support, including Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) Continued enhancements to Edge Cloud, Connectivity Insights and Network Access Management APIs Creation of Session Insights sandbox API repository, which will enable real-time visibility into device behavior and network sessions from application to network operator. This was previously called Quality by Design and is now called Session Insights at CAMARA. You can explore the full scope of the spring 2025 meta-release on the CAMARA wiki or read the Linux Foundation\u2019s summary . This spring release is the first of two planned for this year . After being released by CAMARA, APIs are available for anyone to download and use. The fall 2025 meta-release is currently in the planning phase.

If you have previously deployed an application server to that edge cloud zone, then connecting that device\u2019s application client to it will usually result in the lowest latency and packet loss \u2013 and improved end user experience. If you don\u2019t have an application server running there, you can decide whether to deploy an application server there using the named edge cloud provider\u2019s APIs. Use Cases Network operators deploy edge computing zones in their networks to bring content and compute closer to user\u2019s connected devices. This can reduce latency, jitter and loss; and can ensure data communication stays within a given territory. The Simple Edge Discovery API returns the name of the edge cloud zone with the shortest network path to a given end user device. You can use this information to connect the user device to an application server you already have running on this edge cloud zone or spin up an application server there if required (using the edge cloud provider\u2019s APIs). The following use cases are listed as examples: Content Delivery: Optimizing content delivery by directing traffic to the nearest edge cloud zone. Gaming: Reducing latency for online gaming by connecting users to the closest edge cloud zone. IoT Applications: Enhancing the performance of IoT devices by ensuring they connect to the nearest edge cloud zone. Benefits Applications that have strict network performance demands can benefit from deploying servers at the network edge, as can applications that wish to prevent their data from being routed on the public Internet.

This API provides a mechanism for subscribing to events related to SIM swaps, enabling real-time notifications when a SIM swap occurs. By leveraging this API, organizations can enhance security measures, prevent fraud, and improve user experience during critical operations such as account management and transaction validation. This API provides an alternative to the Sim Swap API. In the Sim Swap API, the developer requests the information each time it is required, while with Sim Swap Subscriptions API, the information is sent directly to the application developer when a SIM swap occurs. Use Cases Fraud Prevention in Financial Transactions: Businesses can subscribe to SIM swap events to monitor any changes to a user\u2019s SIM card. This information can be used to trigger additional security measures when a phone number is used as an identifier for a payment application. User Notification for SIM Changes: Organizations can keep users informed  changes to their SIM status, enhancing transparency and trust. This can be particularly useful in industries where user data security is paramount. Customer Support: Providing real-time alerts to support teams for immediate action on potential security threats. Subscription Services: Offering continuous monitoring and notifications to businesses that require real-time updates on SIM card status. Benefits Real-Time Notifications : The subscription model allows businesses to receive immediate alerts when a SIM swap occurs, enabling proactive responses to potential security threats without delay. Versatile Integration Across Industries : This API is designed to be easily integrated into various applications, making it suitable for sectors such as banking, e-commerce, and telecommunications. It supports a wide range of use cases, from fraud prevention to user account management. API call reduction : For applications with a high volume of transactions for certain lines, it helps avoid multiple requests to check for SIM swaps on a given line.

These applications are usually composed of a frontend running on a user terminal, connected via cellular to a backend software running on the telco edge. The backend is a multi-node distributed application, composed of several service nodes running on different telco edge nodes, so that the best performance is achieved. The Application Endpoint Discovery API solves the problem for the frontend to select the best backend service node among all the service nodes deployed on the telco edge computing platform. Use Cases Operators often host multiple Edge Cloud zones across various territories. Connecting an application directly to the optimal Edge Cloud zone endpoint may minimize latency. This API provides the actual endpoints within the nearest zone. This approach ensures that developers can instantly integrate these endpoints into their applications, improving the user experience. After identifying the nearest application endpoint through the API, developers can: Connect their application client directly to the chosen application endpoint, enhancing the responsiveness of the service. If no suitable endpoints are available, the developer can use the API \u201cEdge Application Management\u201d in order to instantiate a new instance. Edge Cloud zone, optimizing their service distribution based on real-time network geography. The API also can be used for IoT Device Management: Enhancing the performance of IoT devices by ensuring they connect to the nearest edge cloud zone, reducing latency and improving response times. Benefits Applications that have strict network performance demands can benefit from deploying servers at the network edge, as can applications that wish to prevent their data from being routed on the public internet.

This API will allow enterprise customers to vividly display their multimedia business cards and reduce the difficulty of malicious calls. Use Cases The Verified Caller API is applicable to customers in industries such as government, finance, express delivery, healthcare, education, etc. who have outbound call needs. For example, when a hospital arranges follow-up and communication between customer service and rehabilitation patients, patients may doubt the hospital\u2019s identity and therefore usually refuse to call. By calling this API, the identity of the hospital can be displayed, thereby improving connection rates and significantly improving customer service satisfaction. Benefits Anti-fraud and Certified Information Provision : By providing accurate operator-certified \u201cbusiness card\u201d information to the called party, it helps prevent fraud. The called person can be sure of the caller\u2019s identity, reducing the risk of being deceived by malicious calls. Flexible Activation : The features of this API can be activated on a per-call or per-time basis. This flexibility allows enterprises to better control its usage according to their actual needs, which is both convenient and cost-effective. Improving Effective Connection Rate : For enterprises with outbound call needs, such as those in government, finance, express delivery, healthcare, and education industries, this API can display the real identity of the caller. For example, when a hospital calls rehabilitation patients, the patients are more likely to answer the call, thus significantly improving the effective connection rate. Cost Saving : A higher connection rate means less time and resources wasted on repeated calls. Enterprises can achieve more with less effort, resulting in cost savings in the long run. Enhancing Enterprise Image : When enterprises can present their accurate identity and professional \u201cbusiness cards\u201d through this API, it gives a positive impression to the called customers.

This post initially\u2026 Read More APIs enabling seamless access to Telco network capabilities Telco network capabilities exposed through APIs provide a large benefit for customers. By simplifying telco network complexity with APIs and making the APIs available across telco networks and countries, CAMARA enables easy and seamless access. Download Solutions Sheet Telco network capabilities are functions partly available already in 4G but new and much more powerful in the 5G network. These functions enable to get information out of the network but also to configure the network. The on-demand, secure and controlled exposure of these capabilities pave the way for transforming operator networks into service enablement platforms, facilitating the application-to-network integration, which will be key to deliver enhanced and servicetailored customer experience in the 5G era. Abstraction by transformation from network capabilities to Service APIs is necessary: To simplify telco complexity making APIs easy to consume for customers with no telco expertise (user-friendly APIs) To satisfy data privacy and regulatory requirements To facilitate application to network integration CAMARA is an open source project within Linux Foundation to define, develop and test the APIs. CAMARA works in close collaboration with the GSMA Operator Platform Group to align API requirements and publish API definitions. Harmonization of APIs is achieved through fast and agile created working code with developer-friendly documentation. API definitions and reference implementations are free to use (Apache2.0 license).

This covers the releases of Working Group deliverables and the releases of APIs by the API Sub Projects. It also defines the meta-release process that enables managing consistency across APIs. CAMARA meta-release A CAMARA meta-release combines a set of CAMARA API versions into a consistent release. There are two meta-releases per year (in spring and in fall) such that API providers can plan their API implementations and deployments in production. API consumers can plan the integration in their platform and applications. All API versions in a meta-release comply with the CAMARA guidelines from Commonalities and Identity and Consent Management (part of that same meta-release) and fulfill defined quality criteria. CAMARA meta-releases ensure Availability of consistent API definitions (by use of guidelines, templates, and linting), Quality of API definitions (by use of checklists, test definitions, and release management), Stability of API definitions (clear criteria for stable versus initial API versions) and Reliability of schedule and deliverables (with defined milestones and release candidates). CAMARA meta-releases provide the foundation for API version management in production. API versions and their release CAMARA follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 for API versioning (x.y.z). CAMARA differentiates between initial API versions (x = 0) and stable API versions (x > 0). There are some CAMARA specific rules for releasing initial API versions. An API Sub Project may release an initial API version outside of a meta-release (Sandbox APIs only). More mature APIs (Incubating, Graduated) shall release new versions or updates through a meta-release.

This post initially\u2026 Read More APIs enabling seamless access to Telco network capabilities Telco network capabilities exposed through APIs provide a large benefit for customers. By simplifying telco network complexity with APIs and making the APIs available across telco networks and countries, CAMARA enables easy and seamless access. Download Solutions Sheet Telco network capabilities are functions partly available already in 4G but new and much more powerful in the 5G network. These functions enable to get information out of the network but also to configure the network. The on-demand, secure and controlled exposure of these capabilities pave the way for transforming operator networks into service enablement platforms, facilitating the application-to-network integration, which will be key to deliver enhanced and servicetailored customer experience in the 5G era. Abstraction by transformation from network capabilities to Service APIs is necessary: To simplify telco complexity making APIs easy to consume for customers with no telco expertise (user-friendly APIs) To satisfy data privacy and regulatory requirements To facilitate application to network integration CAMARA is an open source project within Linux Foundation to define, develop and test the APIs. CAMARA works in close collaboration with the GSMA Operator Platform Group to align API requirements and publish API definitions. Harmonization of APIs is achieved through fast and agile created working code with developer-friendly documentation. API definitions and reference implementations are free to use (Apache2.0 license).

See if an endpoint or feature is temporarily \u201cnot available\u201d or permanently \u201cnot implemented.\u201d Stay Updated on Changes: Subscribe to receive real-time notifications  any newly introduced restrictions or when existing ones are removed or updated. Adapt Your Requests Automatically: Adjust your application\u2019s logic to avoid making invalid requests by checking up-to-date restrictions info before calling an API. Use Cases Preventing Errors from Unsupported Features: For instance, if an API supports multiple device identifiers (IMEI, MSISDN, etc.) but a particular provider allows only MSISDN, your client can automatically skip the unsupported parameters. Handling Temporary Outages or Unavailability: During large events or maintenance, operations might be suspended. Use this API to gracefully disable those features and show helpful messages to users. Managing Input Constraints: Some numeric fields may have provider-specific limits (e.g., location radius no less than 5 km). Retrieve those limits and validate user input accordingly. Adjusting to Region-Specific Requirements: A provider in region A might mandate an otherwise optional parameter, while region B does not. You can create code that can adapt dynamically based on real-time restrictions. Receiving Notifications for Quick Response: If restrictions change (e.g., a parameter once required is no longer needed), your code can be notified. Your application can update functionality seamlessly without manual intervention. Benefits Reduced Errors & Downtime : By knowing exactly which parameters and operations are valid at any moment, you avoid failed calls and error handling overhead. Improved User Experience : If features are unavailable, your app can hide or disable those options, preventing user frustration or confusion. Future-Proofing : As providers evolve their implementations, your application can dynamically adapt through subscription-based notifications rather than requiring frequent manual updates.

The main scope of the CFS API is anti-fraud to avoid fraudsters to use the Call Forwarding Service to carry on a scam. Other use cases are anyway supported by the CFS API that also provides additional endpoints to detect the general Call Forwarding Service settings. The API consumer invokes the CFS API to determine if a specific phone number has an active \u201ccall forwarding\u201d setup. \u201cCall forwarding\u201d is a network service that redirects incoming calls to another phone number (configured in the service). The CFS API can be used by a bank to verify if a \u201ccall forwarding\u201d option is active on the customer\u2019s phone number to avoid frauds. A call from the bank to the customers can indeed be forwarded to a different number because of a fraud attempt. Use Cases Use Case 1: Phone Fraud The API is useful to avoid fraud. Banks offer the option for users to receive telephone calls to solve problems, e.g. in case of issues with the banking app, issues with smartphones, the bank website or any tool providing access to the online bank account management system. How does the fraudster operate? Through social engineering the fraudster gathers information  bank customers who are engaged in such a situation, needing the bank to  them. Once they identify the service provider and phone number of a customer they manage to successfully activate, on the customer profile, the \u201ccall forwarding\u201d to a phone number they control. After successfully setting up \u201ccall forwarding\u201d the fraudster then s the bank, claiming an inability to access online banking services and requesting a call from a bank representative. When the bank calls the registered  number of the bank customer, the active \u201ccall forwarding\u201d diverts the call directly to the fraudster, thus completing their scheme. The CFS API can be used by the bank to verify if a \u201ccall forwarding\u201d option is active on the customer\u2019s phone, avoiding such a fraud. A use case is \u2018Account Takeover\u2019 protection where CFS API is deployed in tandem with SIM swap to alert banks for possible fraudulent activities. Use Case 2: Alert Interception The call forwarding function can be used by fraudsters to prevent victims from receiving timely reminders or voice alerts. Due to fraudsters controlling the victim\u2019s phone and enabling unconditional call forwarding, police or family members cannot  the right number when trying to reach the victim. The CFS API can help the police to identify whether the number has set up unconditional call forwarding, so as to quickly choose other ways to  the victim, such as instant messaging software. Use Case 3: Call Forward Verification Conditional call forwarding can be used by users to forward calls to enhanced voicemail services or virtual assistant service who can answer the call if the original user is not available to answer, providing a better level of customer service to callers than the standard carrier voicemail. When users are asked to configure the conditional call forward on their number by tapping a forwarding code, this configuration does not always work and requires users to retry the code or restart their phone and try again. With the CFS API it is possible to programmatically check the service configuration status. Benefits The API is useful to avoid fraud, to support voice messaging systems or to support automated call forward service systems to very if the service is properly configured.

It is widely used in digital services, gaming, and subscriptions but is also expanding to other industries. The \u201cCarrier Billing\u201d API initiates and confirms purchase transactions associated to a mobile line (MSISDN). During the checkout process the shopper selects the carrier billing payment option and authorizes the merchant to initiate the payment request to the carrier (provider of the mobile line). It also helps to handle pre-authorization for subscriptions. This API requires 3-legged authentication. There are two ways to use the API defined in CAMARA: 1-STEP Payment: This payment process is completed in a single phase (one action), where all the OB Carrier Billing Systems verify and initiate the charging request against billing systems. 2-STEP Payment : The payment is executed in two phases (two actions). The first action involves a payment preparation request that encompasses all necessary preparations or validations required prior to initiating the payment transaction. The second action requires explicit confirmation or cancellation of the payment by the user. Any payment not confirmed or canceled by the user within a specified time is discarded to maintain consistency in the billing systems. Use Cases Direct Carrier Billing and the Carrier Billing API enable shoppers to use their mobile phone number to purchase certain types of products and services, e.g.: Digital goods & subscriptions App stores & digital content Gaming (in-game purchases, virtual currencies) Streaming services E-books & online courses Cloud storage Physical goods & services Public transport & micromobility (bus tickets, scooter rentals) E-commerce purchases (low-ticket items, event tickets) Vending machines & parking payments Food delivery & quick commerce Carrier-specific services Value-added services (news, insurances, ringtones, horoscope services) Charitable donations (via SMS) 5G-enabled enterprise services (IoT billing, cloud services) Benefits For shoppers: Convenience \u2013 No need for a credit card; payments are frictionless. Security \u2013 No sensitive financial data shared with merchants. Accessibility \u2013 Works for unbanked users and prepaid customers (upon criteria of mobile operator). Speed \u2013 One-tap checkout experience. Global reach \u2013 Available where traditional payment methods are limited. For Merchants: Higher conversion rates \u2013 No need for user registration or card input. Wider audience \u2013 Access to unbanked and younger demographics. Lower fraud risk \u2013 Transactions are tied to a carrier account. Carriers may apply eligibility filters to mobile subscribers to maximize confidence in shoppers. Recurring payments support \u2013 Ideal for subscriptions. Alternative revenue channel \u2013 Particularly for digital content providers.

Upon successfully creating a subscription, the API will provide an event subscription ID, and it will indicate the subscription\u2019s expiration date. After delivering the SMS, the event subscriber will be notified back to the provided notification URL given by the subscription-request. Use Cases The SMS Delivery Notification Subscription API could be useful in scenarios such as: Proactive handling of scenarios/actions based on the delivery status (delivered/not delivered) of SMS. Reliable subscription notification from the API provider would help API consumer in keeping a record of messages/count sent vs. delivered which could be useful in bill validations. Benefits Enhanced customer experience: With message delivery subscription, the consumer of SMS API would know upfront whether the SMS is sent successfully or not and basis that provide user experience proactively rather than after a pre-defined interval.

WebRTC technology has become a game changer for real-time communications, today we are used to video conferencing, instant streaming, web platforms for multimedia content creators and a full UC (Unified Communications) revolution. All of this is a direct result of the massive adoption of WebRTC technology. Three APIs are presented within the WebRTC APIs: WebRTC Registration API : This API manages the registration and connectivity of clients to the operator\u2019s IMS (telephony) network. It ensures that devices are properly identified and authenticated before accessing network services, which is essential for initiating or receiving audio and video sessions. WebRTC Call Handling API : This API enables clients to manage live audio and video sessions over the operator\u2019s telephony network. It allows users to initiate, retrieve, update, and terminate sessions, facilitating functions such as placing calls, upgrading to video, and modifying session parameters. WebRTC Event Subscription API : This API enables customers to receive asynchronous cloud events related to active sessions or new session requests, such as incoming calls or negotiation invitations. It supports event subscriptions for session updates and new session invitations, enabling applications to effectively handle real-time notifications within cloud networking technologies such as orchestrated container solutions. These APIs will leverage unified communications applications to deal with the public network, and they create a standardization milestone around the SDP (Session Description Protocol) exchange on WebRTC scenarios. Use Cases The main use case concept is to leverage the uniform of audio and video sessions along the telecommunications operator and reduce complexity for endpoints to reach the phone network. Some general use cases: Audio video interoperability with non-SIM capable devices . Any device (drones, kiosks, IoT devices, Smart TVs and smart speakers, etc.), all of them can create calls, and reach the public phone network based on its subscriber contract. Connect IA generated voice and media, enabling live-transcription and live-translation, IoT commands, human-voice nature interfaces over all kind of devices, like  smart speakers, automation devices, and interoperate with modern and legacy voice endpoints. Bring easy and understandable tools to developers to create apps that interoperate with multiple manufacturers, cloud providers, voice, and call software providers, removing the barriers and vendor-locks for developers. Offer a unique language to interconnect all voice and video platforms : Private, open source, cloud, or local unified communications platform. All can be connected with the operator network and all can interact using the same language. Bring a modern session exchange protocol , that adapts properly to cloud infrastructures and web technologies. A real alternative to tradition SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) designed initially for UDP networks. Let\u2019s put a practical example: \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Alice is working at the office, with its company E-Kipos platform \ud83d\ude97 Bob is traveling by car \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Carol is from a different company, that works with the open source Yey-tse platform In the event that they wish to communicate with one another, each person can maintain their own experience within their own client. For example, Alice can use an enterprise solution while storing live-transcribed call subtitles, Bob can connect via phone (Bluetooth hands-free), and Carol can use its custom open-source front end. There is no reason for vendor lock-in or platform user retention if all can share the same API to interconnect. Both developers and end-users can focus on the user experience and forget  connectivity, and interoperability of each platform or application. Some detailed use cases for each API: WebRTC Call Handling API: Initiating voice or video calls to any phone number using the operator\u2019s network. Retrieving and updating ongoing sessions to manage call parameters or recover from network disruptions. Terminating sessions when calls are completed. WebRTC Registration API: Registering devices to the network to enable audio and video communication services. Updating or removing device registrations as needed. WebRTC Event Subscription API: Receiving notifications for incoming calls or session invitations. Monitoring the status of active sessions to update user interfaces or trigger specific actions. Benefits WebRTC APIs have the following benefits: \ud83d\ude4b Improved User Experience : By managing registrations and sessions effectively, applications can offer a more reliable and user-friendly communication experience based on modern development frameworks. \ud83d\ude80 Network-Level Quality & Reliability \u2013 Seamless integration with the operator\u2019s network, allowing applications to offer high-quality audio and video communication services. \ud83d\udd04 Real-Time Interaction : With event subscriptions, applications can handle real-time notifications, adapt to network cloud architectures and ensure timely responses to incoming calls and session updates.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5317, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc7a9e6f-1808-486b-a391-b02d4d846584": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc7a9e6f-1808-486b-a391-b02d4d846584", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source": "https://camaraproject.org/webrtc-apis/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e4d623b-9fed-4e80-9569-6199a179f56f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source": "https://camaraproject.org/webrtc-apis/"}, "hash": "7bb7d00e3e7a719ebdb7ba42c19478a928d3475b0c3cec6ff953ac40b1ef2c10", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffe9f6a1-e991-466f-85ef-6b960e5f4861", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source": "https://camaraproject.org/webrtc-apis/"}, "hash": "8265e4fd53e672f2004759aec2f1a30cd66a486e0a05424e178efd1b3a495af8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Retrieving and updating ongoing sessions to manage call parameters or recover from network disruptions.

Network as a Service, a focus area within CableLabs\u2019 Technology Vision, includes the development of Quality by Design and Quality on Demand APIs. Open source collaboration on network APIs will drive the industry forward. CableLabs is at the forefront of innovation for the broadband industry. One new area where this is especially true is in our work developing Network as a Service (NaaS) APIs. As part of this initiative, CableLabs actively contributes to CAMARA, an open source project hosted by Linux Foundation . All of CableLabs\u2019 contributions to CAMARA are part of our NaaS initiative . NaaS allows network operators to expose previously unavailable features to application developers via open source APIs. Alignment with the industry means CableLabs can not only utilize open source APIs, but we can help drive new APIs and adoption from multiple network operators. The end goal is straightforward: Creating happier end users by making applications perform better across all types of networks. What Is CAMARA, and Who Contributes to It? CAMARA focuses on defining, developing and testing APIs that allow interaction with a service provider\u2019s network. The project is closely aligned with the GSMA Open Gateway Initiative for the development, publishing and testing of these open source APIs. Contributors to the CAMARA community include network operators, mobile carriers and application developers. CAMARA aims to simplify APIs that interact with a service provider by abstracting the complexity of the network away. This allows developers to create applications that interact with a service provider\u2019s network without needing to understand which access network is being used or the inner workings and complexities of a mobile, PON or DOCSIS\u00ae\ufe0f networks. Rather than develop solutions for our members in a silo, by contributing to CAMARA, CableLabs helps provide a path to adoption across a broader ecosystem. CAMARA\u2019s open source approach enables rapid development of network-based APIs for companies within the industry. CableLabs\u2019 Contributions to CAMARA APIs The CAMARA APIs align with the work that CableLabs is doing to help improve networks and make APIs more accessible to a broader range of developers, both within and outside a network operator. Quality on Demand APIs: CableLabs contributes to multiple CAMARA projects, starting with expanding the CAMARA Quality on Demand (QoD) APIs to include the QoS profile . This allows an application to set target minimum thresholds for network performance including throughput, latency, packet loss and jitter. You can read more  this in our QoD blog post . Network Access Management APIs: The CAMARA Network Access Management APIs are also something that CableLabs contributes to. These APIs allow for an application to interact with network operator-provided equipment in the . The initial scope of the Network Access Management APIs is to allow actions such as rebooting a device or managing a Wi-Fi network. Edge Cloud: CableLabs also contributes to CAMARA\u2019s Edge Cloud project. This project allows for customers to discover the closest edge cloud zone to a given device for improved application performance. Quality by Design: Working closely with the Connectivity Insights group at CAMARA, CableLabs is developing a new API that takes Quality on Demand a step further. Quality by Design (QbD) defines network requirements and enables an application to communicate its network KPIs \u2014 throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss \u2014 to a network operator. The network operator can then determine the cause of the network performance issues and suggest corrective action. How Do CAMARA APIs Become Available? Twice a year, CAMARA rolls up all of these API projects into what it calls a meta-release . The fall 2024 meta-release \u2014 the first from CAMARA \u2014 is now available. Although the next meta-release isn\u2019t planned until spring 2025, contributions to CAMARA are ongoing. In fact, APIs are even released between meta-releases.
